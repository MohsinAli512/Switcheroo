Switcheroo
==========

*The humble incremental-search task switcher for Windows.*

**Note that I no longer use Windows, so I am no longer developing Switcheroo.  Fortunately, Regin Larson has [forked the project](https://github.com/kvakulo/Switcheroo) and implemented some great improvements.**

Switcheroo is for anyone who spends more time using a keyboard than a mouse. Instead of alt-tabbing through a (long) list of open windows, Switcheroo allows you to quickly switch to any window by typing in just a few characters of its title. It’s inspired by Emacs’s IDO mode buffer switching.


Download
--------
Download the [installer](https://github.com/downloads/jsulak/Switcheroo/Switcheroo_v0.5_setup.exe).

Usage
-----

The default key binding for Switcheroo is `Win+w`.  Pressing this key
combination will bring up the Switcheroo window, which lists the titles
of every open window.  Typing filters the list.  Press enter to switch
to the selected window.  Press `Ctrl-enter` to close the selected window.

The key binding can be changed by right-clicking the notification
icon. 

By default, Switcheroo excludes certain “windows” from the list, for example, “Start,” which represents the Start Menu in Windows 7. This list can be edited from the options dialog.
